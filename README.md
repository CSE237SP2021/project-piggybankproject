# cse237-project
The Piggy Bank Project is an application that is meant to simulate a simple banking application that allows users to interact with their accounts and manage their basic finances. This application is geared towards an audience that is newer to the banking system, as its features include the fundamental structure of most bank accounts. 

In its current form (i.e. Iteration 1), the application allows a user to create a profile or sign in with their chosen username and password. Currently, our program does not allow a user to make a profile with a username that has already been taken. These usernames are stored in a .txt file. Once they have made a profile/signed in, the user is brought to an account page, where they can choose to view their account statistics (i.e. balance), deposit money into their account, or withdraw from their account, if they have sufficient funds in their account. 

We believe that this preliminary structure covers essential actions that could be taken by a user. In upcoming iterations, we plan to expand on many of these ideas, including having the option to make multiple accounts, transfer money between accounts, add multiple users to a single account, build out more information with passwords, and more. Additionally, in this first stage, we did not verify exact inputs by the user for deposit and withdrawal. Specifically, while we did implement making sure that there were sufficient funds for a goal withdrawal, we only tested positive, numerical input and will need to validate this input in the next iteration. We are looking forward to seeing how this project will progress in the next stage!
