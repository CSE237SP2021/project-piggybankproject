# CSE237 Piggy Bank Project

The Piggy Bank Project is an application that is meant to simulate a simple banking application that allows users to interact with their accounts and manage their basic finances. This application is geared towards an audience that is newer to the banking system, as its features include the fundamental structure of most bank accounts. 

In its final form, the application allows a user to create a profile or sign in with their chosen username and password. Our program does not allow a user to make a profile with a username that has already been taken. The login will only be successful if their inputted password matches their originally chosen password. These usernames and passwords are stored in .txt files, along with an account number, account balance, and more. Once the user has made a profile or signed in, the user is brought to an account page, where they can choose to view their account statistics (i.e. balance), deposit money into their account, withdraw from their account (if they have sufficient funds in their account), transfer money to another user, view a log of their transactions from the current session on the application, add another user to their account (to mimic family accounts, shared accounts, etc.), change their password, or delete an account. The program will validate the input taken into these questions, so that user input is logical for the respective action that is prompted. For instance, the user can only input corresponding numbers for which type of transaction they will complete (i.e. only numbers 1-8 for that prompt, etc., unless they find a surprise when entering 9 from the main menu :) ), as well as only positive integer values for monetary amounts for depositing/withdrawal/transferring, and more. This covers the user stories completed in all iterations, with our focuses from this last iteration being adding approved users to an account, password updating functionality, and account deletion, along with respective tests. Once the user is done with their chosen actions (depositing, withdrawing, etc.), they should type 'exit' to complete their session.  

We believe that this structure covers essential actions that could be taken by a user.To run this application, please use the run.sh file in the general repository. Enter ./run.sh to run this file.

We really enjoyed making this project, and we hope that you find it enjoyable to use as well!
